# compare_models_img_capt

I collected these 3 image captioning models from Internet and my teacher.
I have added some code to evaluate and compare 3 models in processing time and BLEU score, METEOR score. I also adjusted some parameters to make 3 models quite similar

These 3 models were trained by 50k images in COCO dataset.
